## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Project skeleton: integration package with the API client subpackage, HACS metadata and development tooling (#45).
- MIT license (#57).
- Continuous integration: linting, type checks, tests against Home Assistant 2026.9 and 2026.8, hassfest, HACS validation and a weekly run against the upcoming release (#47).
- API client: lenient parsing of the panel's responses; unknown states and types are kept and logged once (#5).
- API client: every known panel response is mapped to a result or a typed error, including the installer lock and refused arming with its blocking faults (#4).
- Tests: a simulated panel that behaves like the reference panel, including its connection behaviour, and fails tests that break the panel's rules (#65).
- API client: one HTTPS connection per panel with TLS session resumption, strictly sequential requests with commands ahead of polling, a User-Agent that can be overridden, and connection counters for diagnostics (#2).
- API client: after the panel rejects the credentials (401), no further request is sent with them, not even queued ones (#6).
- API client: one method per API operation the integration uses, returning models (#75).
